1. *Define your problem well!* Have a clear question to answer and know what kinds of answers are acceptable. The better your question is defined, the easier data analysis will be.
2. *Understand your data.* It’s tempting to jump right in and create a flashy visualization, but it’s always best to know exactly what your data are describing. Even if you didn’t create the dataset, most data curators define their data schema and describe what each datum contains. Ask:
- What terms are you unfamiliar with in the data description?
- Are the data changing over time? If so, how?
- What methods or tools were used to collect the data?
- How are the data presented (e.g. pre-filtered, pre-edited, averaged, or raw data points)?
- What are sources of measurement error and how might it affect your conclusions?
- Is there any bias I should keep in mind (experimental or human) while analyzing this dataset?
- Is my data from a reputable source?
- What kinds of summary statistics can I use to describe my data?
3. *Clean up your data.* Not every dataset is perfect when you create it or download it – data is messy. It might be a good idea to remove or ignore some of your data or make your own data points.
- Are there data that you need that are not represented in the data set? If so, can I create my own data using the data I already have?
- How is my data shaped? Are there lots of outliers? Is it skewed? If so, should I remove outliers or normalize my data?
- Are there missing values in my data? If so, can I take a guess at what they should be?
- How much data do I have? Is this enough to make a useful conclusion?
4. *Choose the right type of visualization.* There are lots of different options to choose from – picking the best visualization for your data makes it much easier to communicate insights.
- Line chart: change over time
- Bar chart: categorical data (e.g. gender, but not age).
- Scatter plot: correlation between two variables (e.g. height vs. weight)
- Bubble chart: correlation between three variables (e.g. height vs. weight vs. age)
- Pie charts: categorical parts of a whole – showing proportions
- Histogram: distribution of one numerical variable (e.g. age)
- For more complicated data, there are lots of other cool plots - look around before you decide what to use!
5. *Reference multiple data sources.* There’s no law against using more than one data source! Sometimes the best answers to research questions use data from different sources to answer the same question from different perspectives. The more data you have to supplement your analysis, the more confident you can be in your conclusions.
6. *Keep it simple!* The best visualizations can be understood easily and quickly – otherwise, we’d simply show the data. Make sure every chart has clear, concise labels, a title that says in words what the graph shows, and a caption to provide additional context if necessary.
